# Mary_TheMoodMonitor
Hi, I am Mary, your mood is very important to me. Don't worry, this is a safe space where you can tell me anything, and my job is to figure out how you are feeling and comfort you. 

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by a number of young people suffering from anxiety, panic attack and similar stressful situation in life. 

## What it does
User can enter the input following the question "How are you feeling?" and such questions. The application itself will generate answers to detect what kind of situation that the person might be in and offer words to comfort the user

## How we built it
We use Python Tkinter, Pandas, Scikit-learn to build the project. Tkinter was for the front-end of our application. And we use Pandas to extract .csv file for data which later on is used for generate answer with the help of Scikit-learn. To generate the answer, the application uses Naive Bayes algorithm to detect what kind of situation the user experiences. 

## Challenges we ran into
This application is challenging since psychology is a wide topic and there are too many reasons that causes a panic attack or a mental breakdown. And we were having trouble when detecting the data itself. To be more precise, we were having trouble with parsing the text, since there are non-English symbols/ letters. Sometimes the program generates unexpected accuracy rates. Our teammates are not familiar with AI/ML models.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proudly to present an application that allows user to stay calm after an incident. We are proud to finish the application which is important for our user's safe space.

## What we learned
We learn a lot about new Python Library. There are teammates who firstly knew how to use Tkinter, there are people who don't know anything about AI/ML models but still took times and learned about Naive Bayes algorithms, and Pandas. \n

## What's next for Mary - the Mood Monitor
Mary - the Mood Monitor will be developed to generate better answers with higher accuracy and better user experience.
